# Iron FTC
This is the Core repository for Iron FTC, an advanced modular framework for building robot control systems on top of the FIRST Tech Challenge robot controller app. This is one of a few planned repositories for the Iron FTC ecosystem, and is designed to be as little as necessary in order to provide full functionality and some of the more advanced features on the roadmap for Iron.

## About
Iron is not a library which can just be inserted into any codebase. It is designed to fundamentally change the way that codebases are made and maintained. Each piece of Iron - the OpModes, the hardware augmentations, positioning data, and frameworks - are modules which are connected by the Iron FTC framework.
